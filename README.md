INTERNSHIP SUPPORT AND MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

The Internship Support and Monitoring System (ISMS) is a comprehensive platform designed to streamline and manage the internship process for students and administrators/facilitators. It enables students to register, submit and track internship requirements, browse internship opportunities, access downloadable forms, and receive real-time notifications. The system also allows them to monitor their progress and provide feedback on their internship experience.

For admins and facilitators, ISMS offers tools to verify student accounts, review and approve documents, track student progress, manage internship partners, set deadlines with detailed instructions, and send reminders. It also provides a centralized repository for internship-related forms and templates, ensuring students have access to the correct documents.
